<h1>How this works</h1>

"Buying real estate is about more than just finding a place to call home. Investing in real estate has become increasingly popular over the last 50 years and has become a common investment vehicle.

Although the real estate market has plenty of opportunities for making big gains, buying and owning real estate is a lot more complicated than investing in stocks and bonds. In this article, we'll go beyond buying a home and introduce you to real estate as an investment. (For more, see our Real Estate Investing Guide.)

Basic Rental Properties
This is an investment as old as the practice of land ownership. A person will buy a property and rent it out to a tenant. The owner, the 
landlord, is responsible for paying the mortgage, taxes and costs of maintaining the properties." - Andrew Beattie

"First, it's important you understand that property values do not always increase.  This can become painfully evident during periods like the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the 2007-2009 real estate collapse.  In fact, in many cases, property values rarely beat inflation.  For example, if you own a $500,000 piece of real estate and inflation is 3%, your property might sell for $515,000 ($500,000 x 1.03%) but you aren't any richer than you were last year.  That is, you can still buy the same amount of milk, bread, cheese, oil, gasoline, and other commodities (true, cheese may be down this year and gasoline up, but your standard of living would remain roughly the same).

 The reason?  The $15,000 gain wasn't real.  It was nominal.


This happens because the government has to create money when it spends more than it takes in through taxes.  All else equal, over time, this results in each existing dollar losing value and becoming worth less than it was in the past.

One of the ways that the savviest real estate investors can make money in real estate is to take advantage of a situation that seems to crop up every few decades: When the rate of inflation is projected to exceed the current rate of long-term debt, you might find people willing to gamble by acquiring properties, borrowing money to finance the purchase, and then waiting for inflation to increase. That way, they can pay off the mortgages with dollars that are worth far less.  This represents a transfer from savers to debtors.

 You saw a lot of real estate investors making money this way in the 1970s and early 1980s as inflation began to spiral out of control before Paul Volker took a 2x4 to its back and brought it under control by drastically raising interest rates.

The trick is to buy when cyclically adjusted cap rates are attractive or when you think there is a specific reason that a particular piece of real estate will someday be worth more than the present cap rate alone indicates it should be.  For example, talented real estate developers can look at the right project, at the right time, at the right price, and quite literally create the future rental income to support a valuation that might otherwise appear rich based on present conditions because they understand economics, market factors, and consumers.

 In my old hometown, I watched a terrible old hotel on a great piece of land get transformed into a bustling shopping center with office buildings pumping out considerable rents for the owner.  Absent those cash flows, present or net present value, you are speculating to some degree or another, no matter what you tell yourself, no matter which banks approve your loans, and no matter what society around you says.  You will require either substantial inflation in the nominal currency (if you're using debt to finance the purchase) to bail you out or some sort of low probability event to work out in your favor." - <a href="#" style="color:dodgerblue">TheBalance.com</a>
